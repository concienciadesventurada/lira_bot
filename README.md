# LIRA BOT

My attempt to make a bot join voice channels and play sounds and function as
a TODO app on steroids. This is also a project for me to implement common
data structures and algorithms. What I strive to achieve is a bot that handles
different data structures and plays enqueued sounds in these data structures.
For example: it holds a Queue, a Stack, and a Doubly Linked List for insertion.
I'll try to stick here whatever I find the most interesting to do.

Use `yarn watch` to compile and then `yarn dev` to run the `index.js`.
